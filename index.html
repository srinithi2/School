        <p> A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory. In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university.In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (elementary in the US) and secondary (middle school in the US) education. Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5). University, vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary school. A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or a school of dance. Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.Non-government schools, also known as private schools,may be required when the government does not supply adequate, or specific educational needs. Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, gurukula (Hindu schools), madrasa (Arabic schools), hawzas (Shi'i Muslim schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training, military education and training and business schools.Critics of school often accuse the school system of failing to adequately prepare students for their future lifes,of encouraging certain temperaments while inhibiting others,of prescribing students exactly what to do, how, when, where and with whom, which would suppress creativity,and of using extrinsic measures such as grades and homework, which would inhibit children's natural curiosity and desire to learn.In homeschooling and distance education, teaching and learning take place independent from the institution of school or in a virtual school outside a traditional school building respectively. Schools are commonly organized in several different organizational models, including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school.India .This section does not cite any sources.

(June 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)A school building in Kannur, India. In ancient India, schools were in the form of Gurukuls. Gurukuls were traditional Hindu residential schools of learning; typically the teacher's house or a monastery. During the Mughal rule, Madrasahs were introduced in India to educate the children of Muslim parents. British records show that indigenous education was widespread in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque or village in most regions of the country. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion.Under the British rule in India, Christian missionaries from England, USA and other countries established missionary and boarding schools throughout the country. Later as these schools gained in popularity, more were started and some gained prestige. These schools marked the beginning of modern schooling in India and the syllabus and calendar they followed became the benchmark for schools in modern India. Today most of the schools follow the missionary school model in terms of tutoring, subject / syllabus, governance etc.with minor changes. Schools in India range from schools with large campuses with thousands of students and hefty fees to schools where children are taught under a tree with a small / no campus and are totally free of cost. There are various boards of schools in India, namely Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), Madrasa Boards of various states, Matriculation Boards of various states, State Boards of various boards, Anglo Indian Board, and so on. The typical syllabus today includes Language(s), Mathematics, Science – Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, History, General Knowledge, Information Technology / Computer Science etc.. Extra curricular activities include physical education / sports and cultural activities like music, choreography, painting, theatre / drama etc.</p>

        <h2>School Canteen</h2>
        <p>The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>
        <h3>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h3>
        <img src="https://5.imimg.com/data5/ZA/SJ/QC/SELLER-7950336/rfid-smart-attendance-for-school-500x500.jpg">
        <p>1. Accuracy Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
            2. Economics Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
            3. Productivity / Efficiency Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.

        <p>KMHSS manifests its quality through its extensive continuing Professional Development that enhances and broadens the professional knowledge, skills and expertise of the teachers leading to improve and memorable learning experiences and achievements by the students.

            We value relationships and connections with the community. We encourage our students to develop respectful relationships with their peers, teachers and the broader community. We instil in our children, a keen social conscience and the capacity to make ethical decisions.

            I strongly believe that sustained productive partnerships and connections with parents, support learning and acquisition of positive values among children. So, my request to all parents is to stay involved in their child’s development and ensure every child’s physical and mental well being.

            Our collective success over the past 18 years has taught us the need to upkeep the quality of our work by maintaining a high level of individual effectiveness. Indeed, Quality is the milestone that we strive to reach. But the quest for excellence continues…

            Our goal at Kalaimagal Matric. Hr. Sec. School, Mohanur, is to provide an enriching, engaging and exploring curriculum that will prepare the students to become innovative thinkers, creative problem solvers and inspired learners for achieving success. Education is a team effort. Teachers and Parents are the important part of the team, who are the coordinating wheels to drive the students always on the road to success, to reach their goal in a fruitful way. Our Institution always believes that Education is a shared commitment between dedicated teachers, motivated students and enthusiastic parents with high expectations.
